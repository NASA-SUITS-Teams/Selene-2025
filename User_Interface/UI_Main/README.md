# Main UI Folder

This is where the actual development will happen for our UI. I would like to meet with the GUI Sub-team to brainstorm our exact layout of how we want to structure the interface, and then we can be begin coding from there. 

# Stack

Stack will consist of the following:

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, React

**Backend:** Node.js, Express.js 

**Tools:**  Postman, Docker(maybe), Github

# Order of priorities

> 1: Start with simple backend server

> 2: Play with Postman

> 3: Establish simple API endpoints

> 4: Move on to frontend

# Setup
Refer to [UI_Setup](./../UI_Setup/) for instructions on how to get packages installed for development. Currently, we only have steps for the backend setup right now.
