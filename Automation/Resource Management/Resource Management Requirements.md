# Autonomous Resource Management (ARM)
## Objectives
- Monitor and optimize the use of critical resources (e.g., oxygen, power, water).

- Provide predictive analytics to prevent resource depletion.

- Ensure crew safety by maintaining life support systems within nominal ranges.

## Functional Requirements
### P0: Mission-Critical
#### Resource Monitoring:

- Shall continuously monitor key life support parameters:

  - Oxygen levels (primary and secondary tanks). (P0)

  - CO2 levels. (P0)

  - Battery status. (P0)

  - Water levels (coolant and waste). (P0)

- Shall display real-time resource data on the PR interface. (P0)


#### Caution and Warning System:

- Shall implement a multi-tiered alert system:

  - Caution: Visual alerts for minor deviations from nominal ranges. (P0)

  - Warning: Visual and auditory alerts for significant deviations. (P0)

  - Critical: Immediate action required to prevent catastrophic events. (P0)

- Shall provide actionable recommendations for resolving resource-related issues. (P0)

### P1: High Priority
#### Resource Optimization:

- Shall prioritize essential functions (e.g., life support, communication) during resource shortages. (P1)

- Shall provide estimates of remaining resources at each destination. (P1)

- Shall suggest turn-around points to prevent resource depletion. (P1)

#### Predictive Analytics:

- Shall use machine learning models to predict future resource usage based on current consumption patterns and historical data. (P1)

- Shall provide real-time updates on resource depletion risks. (P1)

### P2: Medium Priority
#### Logging and Analysis:

- Should log resource data for post-mission analysis. (P2)

### P3: Low Priority
#### Advanced Resource Allocation:

- May optimize resource allocation by adjusting non-essential systems (e.g., lighting, non-critical sensors). (P3)
